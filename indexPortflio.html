        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hi, I'm Anya. I am currently 19 years old and studying Computer Science <br> at Stony Brook University. I was born in Kolkata, India and I have been <br> living in the U.S for the past 4 years. Some of my hobbies include playing <br> basketball, listening to music, and video editing. Out of highschool I barely <br> had any coding experience, but I began to get more efficient with coding in<br> Java and HTML with the courses I took in college. Although the course was <br>challenging, I began to like data structures and as they helped to provide <br>efficient solutuons to coding problems with its complex algorithms. Some of <br>my favorite subjects would include binary trees and heaps. I'm still exploring <br>both front and back end development. I am interested in the tech field,<br> particularly in the creative/media field such as with entertaiment companies.

                So far I've only worked on a few projects with my knowledge in programming languages like Java, JavaScript, <br>as well as HTML and CSS which I am still learning. I'm also exploring C, C++, and Python. I hope to continue <br>learning more programming skills and create coding projects. In the future, I also hope to be involved with <br>software development, particularly in an entertaiment/media field.
